# Segmentation & Classification of Argumentative Structures in Essays

## What? Why?

Part of our university research project. In this project, we are aiming
to segment and classify different elements of arguments like:
- topic (?)
- lead
- premise
- argument (can be more than 1)
- evidence
- counter-argument (can be more than 1)
- conclusion
